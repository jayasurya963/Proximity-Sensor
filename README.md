✨  Project Note :)

🚀 These are two unique ideas, built as two separate projects — one in Arduino, the other in Go — both exploring proximity sensing in their own way.

💡 Community contributions, updates, and enhancements are highly encouraged — every small improvement brings us closer to something bigger and better.

🤝 Let’s build!!

 1. Arduino-Based Project
📦 Project Name: arduino-proximity-sensor

📄 Description:
A simple Arduino sketch that uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure distance and display it via the Serial Monitor. Ideal for beginners in embedded systems and IoT.

-----

 2. Go-Based Project (Raspberry Pi + Firebase)
📦 Project Name: proximity-sensor-service

📄 Description:
A Go-based microservice that reads distance from an HC-SR04 sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi and uploads the data to Firebase Realtime Database. Built for real-time IoT telemetry with cloud integration.
